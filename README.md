# Assignment-2: Page Ranking of Web Graphs


## 2A
```
1. This assignment is aimed at implementing the PageRank algorithm from scratch.
2. The PageRank algorithm should be implemented with and without random teleportations using the
following two methods â€“
A. Finding the principal left eigenvector of the probability transition matrix directly i.e., by making use
of numerical linear algebra packages
B. Finding the principal left eigenvector of the probability transition matrix Power Iteration method.
```

The first two steps remain same for the both the parts

1. Construct Adjacency Matrix using `constructAdjM(input_file)`
2. Construct Probability transition Matrix `constructProbTransMatrix(V, adjM, random_teleport=True, alpha=0.9)` where alpha is the teleport operation probability
   
For part-1:
3. Compute principle left eigenvector via `compute_principle_left_eigen_vector(P)` which will be treated as steady state probabilities as well as ranks 

For part-2:
3. Use power iteration method until the vector converges. `power_iteration`. The converged vector is treated as steady-state vector.

4. To get the Pages in ranked order, use `get_ranks(pi)` where you feed in the steady state probabilities.
